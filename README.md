# Jira-Server Plugin with ReactJS-Frontend

In this Plugin I'm using [Atlaskit](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/) which is primary for Atlassian Products and their plugins hosted in the cloud. In this example you can find a way to implement a modern UI in your not-so-modern Jira-Server-Plugin.
I know how hard it can be to develop for Jira-Server (or any other Atlassian-Server-Product), especially when you try to implement a user-friendly UI. With ReactJS and the Component-Library of Atlaskit you can start developing your plugins with a more "modern"-touch.
Just use the REST-Module of the Atlassian Plugin Framework to define your backend and fetch the needed data with your react-app.

**Don't buy ANY Atlassian Products! If you have to waste your money, please contact me.**
