# Jira-Server Plugin with ReactJS-Frontend

In this Plugin I'm using [Atlaskit](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/) which is primary for Atlassian Products and their plugins hosted in the cloud. In this example you can find a way to implement a modern UI in your not-so-modern Jira-Server-Plugin.

**Don't buy any Atlassian Products! If you have to waste your money, please contact me.**
